<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am originally from Wuhan, China. I have been deeply fascinated by Japanese culture since my high school years, 
  which led me to major in Japanese during my university studies and become proficient in the language. Four years 
  ago, I came to Japan, where I spent two years at a Japanese language school and another two years at Musashino 
  University.</p>

<p>The motivation for my study abroad experience was my profound interest in intercultural communication. To better 
  understand different cultures, I have also studied English and Korean in addition to Japanese. This enables me to 
  facilitate smooth communication in multiple languages and gives me confidence in being a bridge between cultures. 
  I look forward to utilizing my cross-cultural understanding in a global workplace like yours.</p>

<p>After graduating in April this year, I worked at a flower shop where I had previously held a part-time job during 
  my student years. I changed my employment status to a full-time employee and worked there for about a year and a 
  half, including my part-time tenure. As it was a small company, I was involved in various aspects of the company's 
  operations. While my main responsibilities included handling the import of foreign materials for the company and 
  translation work, I also gained experience in tasks ranging from office administration to inventory management and 
  negotiating with customers regarding flower deliveries.</p>
